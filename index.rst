How Big Is My Septic Tank
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What does it matter if you know the size of your septic tank? Because it impacts how frequently it needs to be pumped in order to maintain top performance.

In general, we recommend pumping your septic tank every 3-5 years – the smaller the tank, the more frequently it must be pumped. Tanks that go too long without this maintenance are more likely to become backed up or fail, necessitating costly repairs or replacement.

**Step 1:** Determine how many people will use your septic system on a regular basis. Most municipalities assume four regular residents in a two-bedroom property, for example. Six people can fit into a three-bedroom home.

**Step 2:** Calculate how many bathrooms the septic tank will be able to handle. Include the second bathroom in your count if you just have one bathroom now but want to install one later to avoid having to replace your tank.

**Step 3:** Count how many plumbing fixtures you have in your home. This figure includes all faucets, toilets, showers, dishwashers, laundry washers, and any other septic tank-draining fixture.

**Step 4:** To ascertain proper septic tank sizing, take your calculations to your local permission office and compare them to your local laws. The guidelines for sizing differ slightly from one place to the next.

**Step 5:** A tank of at least 1,250 gallons is required in Arizona for a three-bedroom house with two bathrooms and around 20 fixtures. A 2,000-gallon tank is required for a building with 14 residents and three to five baths.
